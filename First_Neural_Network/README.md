My First artificial neural network !
====================================
In this repo we will use Keras, (a neural network API written in Python and integrated with TensorFlow):

- will prepare and process data for artificial neural networks,
- build and train artificial neural networks from scratch,
- build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
- implement fine-tuning and transfer learning .
